# Mass-mailing
Hii there guys!!
You can use this to save you the trouble of sending mass mails with attachments at once without taking any subscrition of any kind.
To use this I would suggest you to do the following things beforehand(ignore if already done):-
1. You need to go to your email account settings and set allow less secure app access to 'On'.
2. You can feed in emails via a list, .csv or an excel file whatever you wish.
3. Now you will have to enter the sender's email and password.
4. For rest you can read the comments I have added throughout the notebook.
